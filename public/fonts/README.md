# Font installation

The Roboto font files are not tracked in git. To enable the local font-face declarations in `src/styles/main.css`, download the `Roboto` family from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) and place the following files in this directory:

- `roboto-400.woff2`
- `roboto-700.woff2`

These filenames should match the ones referenced in `main.css`. Keep the files in WOFF2 format for optimal performance.
